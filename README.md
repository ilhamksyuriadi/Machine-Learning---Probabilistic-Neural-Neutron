# Machine Learning - Probabilistic Neural Network
Probabilistic Neural Neutron code example

Assumption: You already understand the concept of Probabilistic Neural Neutron

Given: Build a Probabilistic Neural Network system to classify 30 test data based on 150 training data provided. Training data and test data can be seen in the file data_train_PNN.txt and data_test_PNN.txt. Data has 3 (three) attributes that are spread in 3 class (class 0, 1, and 2). Observe the smooth value to find good accuracy.

Goal: Identify test data base on train data with probabilisic neural neutron and observe the smooth value

Hint:
1. Smooth value can u see on smooth variable on the code
2. The code find the accuracy ten times (you can modify it) and show the avrerage of it
3. When you run the code data train split to train data and test data with ratio 67:33 randomly
4. For code's guide read Guide.txt
